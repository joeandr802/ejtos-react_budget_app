# READ ME:
The original code has some unintended bugs that I attempted to fix, such as the Application Form not being able to modify the HR budget due to a misnamed value.
I attempted to fix these bugs where I saw them, but I only had limited time and probably missed some.
Just note that any bugs you find may be from the original code, and not from me.

There's a comment about it in the code, but I disabled the option for the Application Form to modify the "Admin" budget.
This is because "Admin" is not actually in the list of expense categories in AppContext.js, and I chose to remove it rather than add it.
It was not a requirement of the assignment to add the Admin field back in, and I'm unsure whether it's actually supposed to be there.
I think this is simply another bug of the original code.
